The total power loss in inductors consisting of the winding resistance loss and the core loss, is modeled by a frequency-dependent equivalent series resistance. The total inductance given by the sum of the main inductance and the leakage inductance is obtained as a function of frequency. In order to study the core equivalent resistance and main inductance versus frequency, the magnetic field distribution in the core is derived from Maxwell's equations for a long solenoid. The complex permeability and permittivity of the ferrite core are introduced in the electromagnetic field equations. Experimental results are also given.},

It has been observed that μeff'' strongly depends on average grain size (G) of the compact, but also on its relative density ϕ: the higher grain size and density the higher μeff''. A mathematical relationship between μeff'' and average grain size and densification has been proposed and tested, accurately reproducing the experimental results. The use of densification concept allows to compare the wide range of microstructures tested and includes a lower value of relative density (estimated around 0,56) below which μeff'' is virtually zero. The grain boundary thickness (δ) has been estimated around 2 nm which is in agreement with experimental results reported in this work and with those found in literature.}

  abstract       = {In order to design power converters and wireless power systems using high-frequency magnetic materials, the magnetic characteristics for the inductors and transformers should be specified in detail w.r.t. the operating frequency. For investigating the complex permeability of the magnetic materials by simply test prototypes, the inductor model-based calculation methodologies for the complex permeability are suggested to find the core loss characteristics in this paper. Based on the measured results of the test voltage Ve, current Ie, and phase difference θe, which can be obtained simply by an oscilloscope and a function generator, the real and imaginary permeability can be calculated w.r.t. operating frequency by the suggested calculation methodologies. Such information for the real and imaginary permeability is important to determine the size of the magnetic components and to analyze the core loss. To identify the superiority of the high-frequency magnetic materials, three prototypes for a ferrite core, amorphous core, and nanocrystalline core have been built and verified by experiment. As a result, the ferrite core is superior to the other cores for core loss, and the nanocrystalline core is recommended for compact transformer applications. The proposed calculation for the complex (i.e., real and imaginary) permeability, which has not been revealed in the datasheets, provides a way to easily determine the parameters useful for industrial electronics engineers.},

The thin-strut formalism permits inclusion of arbitrary fine wires in THREDE without imposing any corresponding demand to reduce the cell size to the wire size. The keystone of this technique is the so-called in-cell inductance-the inductance per unit length a thin wire would have with respect to an enclosing conductor half a cell removed. THREDE results using this formalism are compared with analytic {EMP} solutions for a linear dipole antenna and a loop antenna. Errors are around 10 percent for the loop and 7 percent for the dipole. The 10-percent loop error could probably be improved; the 7-percent dipole error seems to be fundamental to the basic THREDE approximations.},
